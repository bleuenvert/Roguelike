Hello! thanks for checking this project out ^_^

I will update this readme once this game is actually playable but for the time being I will use it as a road map for design choice I want to make after the tutorial is completed.
Dear me: Please link the tutorial!!!!!

I want this to be some dorky game with little philosophy jokes.

Originally I wanted the protagonist to be Diogenes of Sinope.
The player would defeat the enemies by publically masterbating, looking past them in the search for the wise, telling them to stop laying shade upon him.
I still haven't completely ruled this out but the joke kind of runs out of steam after a few minutes.

I think having Plato as the protagonist has legs.
My original inspiration was thinking about Plato as a boss fight. Diogenes would clearly finish Plato off by spawing chickens without feathers who shout "I AM A HUMAN"
Spawning enemies seems more like boss so I thought they should swap roles. 
I also think that Plato has more natural foes:
    - Various sophists (Gorgias, Protagoras, Thrasymachus)
    - Atomists (Democritus)
    - Older thinkers? (Pythagoras, Hermaclitus, Thales)
    - His greatest student Aristotle
    - His teacher Socrates
    - Various followers of Socrates (Xenophon)
    - Perhaps later movements as well viz. Stoics/epicureans
 
 
 There is a joke in there about his Barrel Chest?
 
 Sophists, your attacks could be socratic questioning.
 Atomists could be crushed by elephant sized invisible atoms
 Hermaclitus could be unable to persist as a static object (lol could I code him to constantly change the reference of the object)
 Socrates will try to evade Plato and kill himself lol
 Diogenes boss fight spawns featherless chickens claiming to be humans.
 Maybe Aristotle pops up and makes a quip about the "rational animal"
